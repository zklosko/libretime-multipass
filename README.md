# libretime-multipass

Ever wanted to test out LibreTime but didn't want to tango with
Virturalbox, Vagrent, or Docker?

Canonical released
[Multipass](https://multipass.run), a tool for setting up Ubuntu VMs with Cloud-init files in a snap. Multipass is available for Windows and macOS, as well as Linux OSes that support snaps.

Similar to Docker, Multipass works through a CLI. To use, clone this repo and then open a Terminal (or Command Prompt) inside the created folder and run
```
multipass launch bionic -n ltTEST --cloud-init libretimeTest.yaml  # to launch VM
multipass shell ltTEST  # to enter VM's shell
```

And that's it! At the moment, Multipass isn't patient enough for an automated install, so after you enter the shell for the first time, you will still need to run the install script for LibreTime.

```
sudo ./libretime/install -fiap

sudo service airtime-liquidsoap start
sudo service airtime-playout start
sudo service airtime-celery start
sudo service airtime_analyzer start
```

The IP address of your new VM can be found by running `multipass list`. Copy and paste it into your web browser to access the LibreTime interface.

You can stop the VM with `multipass stop ltTEST` and restart with `multipass start ltTEST`.
If you want to delete the image and start again, run `multipass delete ltTEST && multipass purge`.

timezone: America/New York  # change as needed
ntp:
  pools: ['north-america.pool.ntp.org']
